> Inbox for Suggestions, Comments, and Proposals to improve OrbitDB

This repository is a collection of SCPs to improve OrbitDB - detailed ideas intended solicit discussion that leads to consensus.

### SCP Process

All ideas are welcome. An SCP should start as a pull request to this repo. Merged SCP should be considered "finalized" and ready for development.

### Process Status: `experimental`

This process is itself in flux and may change or end at some point.
